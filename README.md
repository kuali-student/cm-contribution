<h2>Kuali Student Curriculum Management Contribution on Github</h2>

Please refer to the Github based documentation here for the current status of the Git Repositories: http://kuali-student.github.io/

Our intent is that further development take place using this repository with the impex files associated with builds being placed into the ks-development-impex repository.

To start with it is just the development branches for the fused enrollment_aggregate_trunk and the fused enrollment_aggregate_branches_CM-2.0

See: <a href="http://www.kuali.org/ks">http://www.kuali.org/ks</a>

<h2>This Repository</h2>

The cm-contribution repository represents institutional contributions made against the CM 2.x series of releases.  Some of these contributions were accepted and included in later KS CM releases.

This is an archive of these contributions.  

Future contributions should be based on the CM-2.0 branch of the ks-development repository.
